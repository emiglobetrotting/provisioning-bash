provisioning-bash
==========
__provisioning-bash__ is collection of scripts for OS provisioning.

All scripts are written by `bash` so they are easy and useful for your server provisioning.


## Usage (ex. Ubuntu 14)

### Manualy

* If you'd like to provision on existing server, manual operation flow is as follows.

```
# apt-get -y install git
# git clone https://github.com/goldeneggg/provisioning-bash.git

# cd provisioning-bash/ubuntu14
# bash <YOUR_TARGET_SCRIPT>.sh [ARGS]
```

### Vagrant

* If you'd like to run virtual machine using vagrant and provision by scripts, example of your `Vagrantfile` is as follows.

```ruby
# $pf is your target distribution platform
$pf = "ubuntu14"

$master_host = "192.168.56.10"
$repl_pw = "password"

# $provisoners is sample hash object which are target provisioning scripts you'd like to run on your machine
#   "name" key is script name
#   "root" key indicate that this script should be executed by root(privilledged) user
#   "args" key is args array
$provisioners = [
  {"name" => "mysql56-src-sla.sh", "root" => true, "args" => [$master_host, $repl_pw]}
]

Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|

  # :
  # :

  # specify "shell" provisioner
  $provisioners.each do |prv|
    d.vm.provision :shell do |s|
      s.path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goldeneggg/provisioning-bash/master/facade.sh"
      s.args = [$pf, prv["name"], server_id] + prv["args"]
      s.privileged = prv["root"]
    end
  end

end
```

### Docker

* If you'd like to run container using docker and setup by scripts, example of your `Dockerfile` is as follows.

```shell
FROM ubuntu:14.04

MAINTAINER goldeneggg

RUN mkdir /tmp/init
WORKDIR /tmp/init

# facade.sh on remote github.com is copied to local container path
ADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goldeneggg/provisioning-bash/master/facade.sh /tmp/init/facade.sh

# kick facade.sh by RUN task
#   1st arg: platform
#   2nd arg: script name
RUN bash facade.sh ubuntu14 init_ja.sh
```

## Structure

* `ROOT/facade.sh` is facade script of provisioning
* `ROOT/PLATFORM` is directory of each `PLATFORM` (ubuntu14, centos7, etc...)
* `ROOT/PLATFORM/SCRIPT` is script for provisioning (ex. docker.sh, apache.sh, etc...)
* `ROOT/PLATFORM/files/SCRIPT` is directory of configuration files
    * ex. `ROOT/PLATFORM/files/SCRIPT/etc/apache2/conf/httpd.conf` is original file of `/etc/apache2/conf/httpd.conf`.
        * `ROOT/PLATFORM/files/SCRIPT` is path prefix. This file supposes that will be copied to same path of target server/container.
